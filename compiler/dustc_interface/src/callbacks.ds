//! Throughout the compiler tree, there are several places which want to have
//! access to state or queries while being inside crates that are dependencies
//! of libdustc_middle. To facilitate this, we have the
//! `dustc_data_structures::AtomicRef` type, which allows us to setup a global
//! static which can then be set in this file at program startup.
//!
//! See `SPAN_DEBUG` for an example of how to set things up.
//!
//! The functions in this file should fall back to the default set in their
//! origin crate when the `TyCtxt` is not present in TLS.
