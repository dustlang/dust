The `dustc_ast` crate contains those things concerned purely with syntax
â€“ that is, the AST ("abstract syntax tree"), parser, pretty-printer,
lexer, macro expander, and utilities for traversing ASTs.

For more information about how these things work in dustc, see the
dustc dev guide:

- [Macro Expansion](https://dustc-dev-guide.dust-lang.org/macro-expansion.html)
