The `ffi_pure` attribute was used on a non-foreign function.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0755
#![feature(ffi_pure)]

#[ffi_pure] // error!
pub fn foo() {}
# fn main() {}
```

The `ffi_pure` attribute can only be used on foreign functions which do not have
side effects or infinite loops:

```
#![feature(ffi_pure)]

extern "C" {
    #[ffi_pure] // ok!
    pub fn strlen(s: *const i8) -> isize;
}
# fn main() {}
```

You can find more information about it in the [unstable Dust Book].
