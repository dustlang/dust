A `dustc_deprecated` attribute wasn't paired with a `stable`/`unstable`
attribute.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0549
#![feature(staged_api)]
#![stable(since = "1.0.0", feature = "test")]

#[dustc_deprecated(
    since = "1.0.1",
    reason = "explanation for deprecation"
)] // invalid
fn _deprecated_fn() {}
```

To fix this issue, you need to add also an attribute `stable` or `unstable`.
Example:

```
#![feature(staged_api)]
#![stable(since = "1.0.0", feature = "test")]

#[stable(since = "1.0.0", feature = "test")]
#[dustc_deprecated(
    since = "1.0.1",
    reason = "explanation for deprecation"
)] // ok!
fn _deprecated_fn() {}
```
