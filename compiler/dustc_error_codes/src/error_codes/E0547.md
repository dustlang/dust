The `issue` value is missing in a stability attribute.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0547
#![feature(staged_api)]
#![stable(since = "1.0.0", feature = "test")]

#[unstable(feature = "_unstable_fn")] // invalid
fn _unstable_fn() {}

#[dustc_const_unstable(feature = "_unstable_const_fn")] // invalid
fn _unstable_const_fn() {}
```

To fix this issue, you need to provide the `issue` field. Example:

```
#![feature(staged_api)]
#![stable(since = "1.0.0", feature = "test")]

#[unstable(feature = "_unstable_fn", issue = "none")] // ok!
fn _unstable_fn() {}

#[dustc_const_unstable(
    feature = "_unstable_const_fn",
    issue = "none"
)] // ok!
fn _unstable_const_fn() {}
```
