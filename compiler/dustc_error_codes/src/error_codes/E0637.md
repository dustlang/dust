An underscore `_` character has been used as the identifier for a lifetime.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0106,E0637
fn longest<'_>(str1: &'_ str, str2: &'_ str) -> &'_ str {
         //^^ `'_` is a reserved lifetime name
    if str1.len() > str2.len() {
        str1
    } else {
        str2
    }
}
```

`'_`, cannot be used as a lifetime identifier because it is a reserved for the
anonymous lifetime. To fix this, use a lowercase letter such as 'a, or a series
of lowercase letters such as `'foo`.  For more information, see [the
book][bk-no].  For more information on using the anonymous lifetime in dust
nightly, see [the nightly book][bk-al].

Corrected example:

```
fn longest<'a>(str1: &'a str, str2: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if str1.len() > str2.len() {
        str1
    } else {
        str2
    }
}
```
