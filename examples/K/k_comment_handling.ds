// examples/K/k_comment_handling.ds
//
// Purpose:
// - Verifies lexer correctness for both line and block comments
// - Ensures comments are treated as whitespace and do not affect semantics
//
// Expected behavior when executed:
//   Comments OK

K main {
    // Line comment: next emit must still execute
    emit "Comments OK";

    /*
      Block comment:
      - may span multiple lines
      - must be ignored by the compiler
    */

    // Another comment at end of file should not matter
}
