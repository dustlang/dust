# .github/workflows/ci.yml
#
# CI pipeline for the Dust compiler
#
# Goals:
# - Ensure the Rust workspace builds
# - Ensure the DPL frontend + semantics work
# - Ensure we can produce and run a native executable from a .ds file
#
# This is the *proof point* that Dust is a real compiler, not just a parser.
